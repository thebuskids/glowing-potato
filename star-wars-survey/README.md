# Exploratory Data Analysis - Star Wars Survey Data

In this project, we will be performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Star Wars survey data, which included responses from 1,186 individuals.

## Overview

The aim of this project is to explore the demographics (e.g. gender, age) of Star Wars fans vs non-fans as well as the favorability / preferences of the 6 films of the franchise and the characters from the Star Wars universe.

We will be using techniques like `pd.pivot_table`, `pd.melt` and `pd.crosstab`.

## Dataset

## Key Findings

- Even though there are more females who responded, a higher proportion of respondents who watched at least 1 film from the franchise are males.
- Similarly, a higher proportion of respondents who consider themselves fans of the franchise are males.
- Overall, the original trilogy (episodes 4 - 6) was rated more favorably / better received compared to the prequel trilogy (episodes 1 - 3).
